[[:chapter {:title "Introduction"}]]

"
[hara.component](https://github.com/zcaudate/hara/blob/master/src/hara/component.clj) is a dependency injection framework for clojure. The virtues of this type of design for composing large systems has been much lauded. This library places emphasis on building large systems using a toplogy of how subsystems fit together and data of how it is to be configured."

[[:section {:title "Installation"}]]

"Add to `project.clj` dependencies:

    [zcaudate/hara.component \"{{PROJECT.version}}\"]"

"All functions are in the `hara.component` namespace."

(comment (require '[hara.component :as component]))

[[:section {:title "Motivation"}]]

"There are two existing component libraries, namely:
 
- [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component)
- [mount](https://github.com/tolitius/mount)

`hara.component` takes the more simplified idea proposed by the [original](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) library where there is whole system start up and teardown. However, it extends upon that concept by teasing apart configuration and application topology to give cleaner notion of design.

Configuration gives the ability to set the starting state of the entire program and should be easy as possible. Many a system become bloated due to not being able to properly manage configuration, therefore composing systems with configuration at the forefront will make for much simpler code and design. This library was build with this paradigm in mind. 

Additionally, there are additional features that enable developers to write their systems in a clearer fashion.

- support for dealing with arrays of component
- control with nested systems

"

            :only ["component?" "system" "system?" "start" "stop" "started?" "stopped?" "properties"]}]]

"Because component is a framework for building systems, we have to start off with concepts of what we wish to build:

- A `Catalog` searches through files in a smart way and consists of a `FileSystem` and a `Database`
- A `Filesystem` stores and manages files
- A `Database` stores indexed information about files

The most simple representation is:"

(comment
  (defrecord Database []
    component/IComponent
    (-start [db]
      (assoc db :status "started"))
    (-stop [db]
      (dissoc db :status)))

  (defrecord Filesystem []
    component/IComponent
    (-start [fs]
      (assoc fs :status "started"))
    (-stop [fs]
      (dissoc fs :status)))

  (defrecord Catalog []
    component/IComponent
    (-start [store]
      (assoc store :status "started"))
    (-stop [store]
      (dissoc store :status))))

"These definitions are then used in context of specifying a system consisting of two `Catalog` instances, having the same `Database` instance, but different `Filesystem` instances."

        :namespace "hara.component"
        :only ["component?" "system" "system?" "start" "stop" "started?" "stopped?" "properties"]}]]

[[:chapter {:title "Config Driven Design"}]]

"Following on from the general concepts we have have a look at how such a framework can be used in practice.

We will aim to create a system based upon a configuration file. As components are a very high level concept, using the pattern in code is more of a state of mind than following a set of APIs. Therefore in this documentation, it is hoped that a tutorial based approach will demonstrate the core functionality within the library. We seperate the guide into the following sections

- [Probability Model](#probability-model) - How to calculate a bug distribution model.
- [Sampling Model](#sampling-model) - How to sample the distribution model.
- [Implementing Components](#implementing-components) - How to create and pretty up components so they are easy to integrate.
- [The Big Picture](#the-big-picture) - How to think about building and extending systems

The first two chapters are not really about components, but it is important in showing how to create functions based around a particular configuration. The rest of the sections take a comphrensive approach of how to configure and reason about entire systems based on the component approach."

[[:section {:title "The Bug Trapper"}]]

"We are creating a simulation based on trapping bugs in different parts of the house, then tallying up the results and displaying it through a web interface. We can see how the sub-systems connect together in the diagram below:"

[[:image {:src "img/hara_component/dependency.png" :height "400px" :title "sub-system dependencies"}]]

"At the very bottom is a statistical model for generating events ie, how often an insect would be likely to appear given a certain set of conditions such as brightness, dampness, if it is indoors or outdoors, etc. This is used by a number of `traps`, which are an array of devices that simulates events of an insect going into the trap. An insect may or may not be captured by the trap itself and this is also tallied. The `app` itself tracks events over time by putting results into a *'database'* and the server takes live results and outputs a string via http."

The syntax for the `:summary` key should be further explained. What `component/start` sees a initialisation of {:expose [:total]}, it take the first dependency (in this case, `:app`), gets the `:total` submap and exposes it as `:summary` in the system map.

"We have created the bug trapping system based on our [dependency diagram](#sub-system-dependencies). We can visualize the essential components that make up our system in the diagram below:"

[[:image {:src "img/hara_component/system.png" :width "100%" :title "the system"}]]

"The constructors and the dependencies form our system topology whilst the data that initialised our system form our config. There are significant advantages of doing this:

- The final code is almost the same as the diagram of the system.
- There is an isometric correspondence between process and data.
- It clearly seperates data (which is normally loaded from a file) from process.
- It keeps all the initialisations in a single place.
- Systems can be built incrementally in the way that we have just done."

[[:section {:title "Further Extension"}]]
